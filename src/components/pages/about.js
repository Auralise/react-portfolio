            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a veteran of IT Support who is currently making a switch to a career as a developer. To facilitate this, I have undertaken a bootcamp course through Monash University, focusing specifically on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have an interest in programming in general and am experimenting with a variety of different languages such as Go and Rust. As the bootcamp that I am attending is teaching vanilla JavaScript, I have also been experimenting with TypeScript in my own time as well. In the past, I have also had some experience writing applications in C# and C++. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of programming, development and Computing in general, I also have an interests in woodworking, hiking, music and gaming.
